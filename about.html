              I am a Berlin-based designer from India with a background in
              Engineering & Fashion Design. passion for creating user-centric
              and intuitive interfaces that delight users and meet their needs.
              With a web development background, I have a deep understanding of
              user requirements and how to translate them into effective and
              attractive design solutions.

              I have been involved in design since my early days of running my
              mom’s ethnic Indian clothing boutique. This experience has
              sharpened my creativity and aesthetic sense, as well as my ability
              to design appealing and unique products.

              As a web developer, I have built several web applications that
              sparked my interest in interface design and problem-solving.

              As a designer, I pay attention to the details and consider how
              things look and work on the screen to be very important for
              creating successful user experiences. That’s why I use prototyping
              as my tool of choice in exploring interaction models and new
              possibilities.

              In my spare time, I love cooking and experimenting with different
              cuisines. I also like travelling around and seeing things from a
              fresh perspective. I am a dancer from my childhood and enjoy
              hobbies like quilling.
